    <p class="descript"></p>Crucea talienilor in the Stanisoara Mountains is more of a historical landmark to be taken for granted as it is linked to King Carol I. Thus between 1902-1914 the king wanted to create a strategic link between the Moldavian Valley and the Bistrita Valley, and the Italians started to build a road for this purpose. Nowadays it is found on the route DJ 209 B from Malini, Obcina Stinisoarei, Borca, and thus the name of Talienilor Road appeared. Then after the completion of the works on this road, a stone cross was built at the highest point of the road, in the Stanisoara Pass, at 1235 m. Then this stone cross was replaced by a metal cross and a troita, which today have become an important tourist attraction in this area.

    <p class="descript"></p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures. It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.
